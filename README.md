# AI_CHATBOT_WITH_NLP

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : TELLAGORLA BALAMOHAN

INTERN ID : CT6WTDG727

DOMAIN : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 6 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
This is a simple AI-based chatbot built using Python. It interacts with users by identifying intent from user input and responding appropriately using predefined responses. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to classify user queries into intent categories.
# TECHNOLOGIES USED
1.Python ‚Äì------------  Core programming language.

2.NLTK ‚Äì -------------- Natural Language Toolkit for tokenization and NLP preprocessing.

3.scikit-learn ‚Äì------  Used for building the machine learning pipeline.

4.TF-IDF Vectorizer ‚Äì ----- Converts text to numerical features.

5.Logistic Regression ‚Äì------ Used as the intent classification model.

6.Random        ‚Äì--------     For picking a response randomly from the list.

# üåü Features
-- Intent-based chatbot using ML model.

-- Handles user queries related to:

   AI

   Python

   Web development

   HTML, CSS, JavaScript

   VS Code

-- Simple training using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression.

--- No need for deep NLP knowledge ‚Äì beginner friendly.

--- Expandable by adding more intents and patterns in the intents dictionary.

--- CLI-based chat interface.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
1.Install Required Libraries
  Run this in your terminal or command prompt:

  pip install nltk scikit-learn
  
2.Run the Script

  python chatbot.py
  
3.Start Chatting

  --- The bot will start in terminal.

  ---- Type your query (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is AI?‚Äù).

  ---- Type quit to exit.
# üîç Why is it AI?
  1.It uses machine learning (LogisticRegression) to classify user inputs into predefined categories (called intents like "greeting", "ai", "python", etc.).

  2.This classification mimics human-like understanding of text, which is a part of Artificial Intelligence.

# üí¨ Why is it NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
  1.It processes natural human language input (like ‚ÄúWhat is AI?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHi‚Äù, etc.).

  Uses:

  1.nltk to tokenize and prepare text.

  2.TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numerical format.

  3.These are classic NLP techniques to understand the meaning and intent of user input.
